Snoop Dogg,rap,Drop It Like It‚Äôs Hot,"Snoop
Snoop

When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rollie on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‚Äòcause I got it goin' on

I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams
See these ice cubes? See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear
Talkin' all that raspy shit, tryin' to ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest, they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second (Ding)
Matter fact, you should take four, B
And think before you fuck with lil' Skateboard P

When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rollie on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‚Äòcause I got it goin' on

I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the Crip side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much, you thought I was a DJ
""Two, one, yep, three!""
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a livin' room full of fine dime brizzles
Waitin' on the Pizzle, the Dizzle, and the Chizzle
G's to the bizzack‚Äînow, ladies, here we gizzo!

When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‚Äòcause I got it goin' on

I'm a bad boy, with a lot of hoes
Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real boss
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp
On the TV screen, and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now, nigga, stop that!
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you
Must I remind you, I'm only here to twist you
Pistol-whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this mothafuckin' music we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get your issue
Baby, come close, let me see how you get loose!

When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‚Äòcause I got it goin' on

Snoop"
Drake,rap,Headlines,"I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‚Äòcause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
‚ÄòCause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

They know, they know, they know (They know, ayy)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

Yeah!
I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything! Money on my mind!""
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, ""They miss the old Drake"", girl don't tempt me
""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‚ÄòCause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

I be yelling out ""Money over everything!""
""Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!""
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah‚Ä¶

I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel better"
Lil Uzi Vert,rap,XO TOUR Llif3,"Are you alright?
I'm alright, I'm quite alright
And my money's right
8‚Ä¶ (Yeah)
Countin' them bands
All way to the top 'til they be fallin' over
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Countin' them bands
On my way to the top 'til we fallin' over

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""Baby, I am not afraid to die""
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, ""Come on over!""
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out (Hey)
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""I am not afraid to die"" (Yeah)
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge (Yeah)
All my friends are dead, yeah, ooh
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah

That is not your swag, I swear you fakin'
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em (Ooh, yeah)
Medicine, lil' nigga, take some (Yeh, yeh)
Fast car, NASCAR, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

She say, ""You're the worst, you're the worst""
I cannot die because this my universe

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""Baby, I am not afraid to die""
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge"
